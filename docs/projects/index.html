                <h2>Autodrive Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    My current contributions to the TAMU Autodrive Challenge II group involve
                    integrating the pre-existing code base used for the car's processing 
                    to actually run on the physical car using the existing hardware.
                    More specifically, I am optimizing and developing the workflow by which
                    the code that will execute for object detection, recognition, and tracking 
                    may run seamlessly and efficient on the car's GPU and in near real-time. 

                    Through this project, I am also learning substantial
                    amounts of information regarding image processing for object detection, 
                    recognition, and tracking, as well as interacting with and using LiDAR data
                    processing and information. I plan to also learn about using a CAN bus
                    for signal processing, and also crafting signals to issue commands to the
                    microcontrollers and similar low-level electronics which function together
                    to create the car's control system.

                <h2>Project Katabasis</h2>
                <p>
                    Project Katabasis is a project I've been
                    thinking about and planning since late high
                    school inspired by the concept of Eternalism.
                    In essence, it is a procedurally generated meta
                    simulation game which changes over time and adapts
                    to reflect previous events that have occurred within
                    the simulation. This simulation should be largely
                    deterministic in isolation, meaning that a particular 
                    state of the simulation should be easily capable of recreation. 
                    When dealing with a more non-deterministic component like player 
                    interactions, it should attempt to weave the interaction into the
                    simulation's state and produce a divergence is then also recreated 
                    from that point onwards to permanently affect the simulation's 
                    future or outcome. For example, a player helps to save a merchant 
                    from monsters. The simulation state in which the merchant is not 
                    saved is also capable of recreation and can itself run parallel to 
                    the other. This type of simulation is of substantial interest to me 
                    as it adds a novel way to implement story content in a less linear 
                    fashion among other things like simulating time travel. For this reason, 
                    I have been researching ways to leverage generative AI to not only generate 
                    player-driven story content, but also interpret it.

                <h2>Personal Use Discord Bots</h2>
                <p>
                    Envivor and Warbot were two now defunct/deprecated
                    Discord bots I previously worked on using primarily
                    discordjs and ytdl. Their core features, however,
                    involved team-management and administration, 

                    Note that the original purpose of both of these
                    chatbots was to learn and practice JavaScript
                    and Typescript as well as experimenting with
                    networking and database architecture and integration
                    into application code. I plan on using the
                    experience of implementing the two previous versions
                    to focus on a single, updated, fully live-service, and
                    public Discord bot in 2024.

                <h2>FTC Robotics</h2>
                <p>
                    I participated in the FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics competitions
                    from 2017-2019, participating in Relic Recovery and Rover Ruckus
                    for my high school's team, #11918 - Grizzly Bots.

                    With many of the founding members of the club leaving
                    the program after 2016, I joined the program to
                    help keep it alive despite my lackluster
                    understanding of computers at the time.

                    With a limited budget and small group of remaining upperclassmen,
                    I took up the lone role of learning how to write software for the
                    robot to run and give our team the best possible results at
                    competitions. 

                    At the time, I had little to no programming experience,
                    so I consider this club as my first experience with
                    programming in any capacity, and also my first
                    experience learning how software could interface
                    with hardware to perform various tasks in the real world.
                        
                    In retrospect, I find that this club to be an endearing and
                    foundational experience in encouraging and motivating me to
                    learn more about computers in general, even if the results
                    I received were holistically disappointing at the time.

                <h2>YMCA Youth and Government</h2>
                <p>
                    I was selected to represent my district at the annual
                    State Conference as a House Representative for the
                    2018-2019 and 2019-2020 program years.
                        
                    I would consider my finest achievement
                    within the program to be the final public policy
                    bill I created and defended regarding the protection of
                    consumer data privacy. Remarkably, Texas HB4 from the
                    88th Texas State Legislative Session was
                    similar in premise to the bill 
                    I proposed and presented many years before the
                    state legislature met, albeit much more refined legally.
                    This was exciting considering I feel particularly
                    passionate about the need for data protection law
                    in the state of Texas, especially as tech companies
                    have increasingly expanded their influence into the state.
                    The passage of this bill through both chambers of Congress
                    in a bipartisan and overwhelming majority was indicative
                    of the need to ensure users have more control over the 
                    the data a company might use. Such a bill being signed into law
                    by Governor Abbott vindicated my predictions about
                    what kinds of public policy within the state of Texas
                    were truly important. 
    
                    Overall, this program was instrumental in building my
                    public speaking, technical writing, argumentation, debate,
                    and etiquette skills as well as providing me a deeper
                    understanding of the American legislative process.
