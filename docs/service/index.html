                <h2>Holiday and City Event Volunteering</h2>
                <p>
                    During high school, I volunteered for
                    the City of Leander's Trunk-or-Treat and
                    Round Rock's Christmas Dreams & Snowy Things
                    events regularly. I would also attend STEM
                    nights held at various middle schools within
                    or near the City of Leander to encourage middle
                    school students to get interested in the STEM
                    programs that would be available to them to take
                    in high school. I particularly liked to represent
                    my school as a STEM student because I felt I
                    helped to alleviate and disprove many of the
                    stereotypes and fears young middle school students
                    had regarding their educational abilities.

                <h2>Volunteering for School-related Functions</h2>
                <p>
                    Also during high school, I volunteered for
                    a number of events as a representative of
                    my school. I often would act as a greeter
                    and cleaner for my high school's theatre
                    performances, help organize and contribute
                    to the annual club parades, and assist the
                    administration as an office aide during
                    free periods and acting as a member of
                    the school's technical support system for
                    fixing student laptops. As a member of the
                    National Honor Society, I also participated in
                    most of the service projects my chapter
                    participated in.

                <h2>Fundraising, Mentoring, or Volunteering for Local Robotics Programs</h2>
                <p>
                    Having experienced what it was like to participate in a
                    robotics program with little funding, I know how
                    discouraging it can be to even the most passionate
                    communities. 
                    For this reason, I would like to volunteer to teach
                    participants about developing software for
                    robots in a beginner-friendly and intuitive
                    fashion. Additionally, I believe providing my perspective
                    as someone who learned how to program through trial-and-error
                    initially might also allow me to relate to many
                    participants. Whether it be speaking about various issues I
                    recall having, helping students with difficult debugging,
                    advertising to promote and fundraise for the program, or
                    simply refereeing matches, I would like the opportunity
                    to make myself an accessible resource for the future
                    software developers to learn from.
