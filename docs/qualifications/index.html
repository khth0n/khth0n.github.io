                <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Programming to me isn't so much about knowing languages anymore
                    as much as it being able to implement my ideas the easiest.
    
                    That said, I am the most familiar with JavaScript/Typescript, C/C++, Python,
                    and I regularly switch between them depending on the workload I am handling.
    
                    I do also have experience with x86_64 and ARM assembly from my education,
                    although I greatly prefer reduced instruction sets like ARM and RISC to
                    x86_64.
    
                    Nonetheless, I am also confident in learning any new programming languages relatively
                    quickly as needed.

                <h2>Experience Across Computing</h2>
                <p>
                    I've had experience using Linux VMs, remote and local, for approximately 7 years
                    and during that time I've continually learned about that specific operating system.
                    Whether it be basic system and network managament, something more complex
                    like network programming on sockets, or using low-level driver APIs to leverage
                    hardware like GPUs, I've personally experimented with many facets of the Linux
                    operating system. Using this knowledge, I've spread out into learning IoT and
                    embedded systems with Raspberry Pi and how to leverage containerization in
                    establishing reliable environments.

                <h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I have quite a bit of experience working on a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js)
                    stack for serving dynamic web content from simulating different types of network architectures
                    in virtual networks of VMs in an attempt to mimic realistic web traffic. NGINX was another
                    back-end technology that I've used before when stress testing and load balancing the simulated
                    web traffic. Although I only have very basic understanding of Angular from creating essentially
                    GUIs, I am confident about my abilities to use MongoDB, Express, and Node.js to built out a
                    functional back-end for just about any application.

                <h2>AI/ML and Computer Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    My interest in AI/ML is fairly related to Computer Vision. In many cases,
                    real-world computation requires the interface of hardware with software,
                    and a method of automatically interpreting information at an incredibly
                    fast rate. Given that there not absolute algorithms for every complex
                    problem, such as face tracking, motion tracking, etc. it becomes glaringly
                    apart where exactly AI/ML can come into play, particularly when paired with
                    an information-rich medium such as Computer Vision.

                <h2>Simulation Software Development</h2>
                <p>
                    My interest in simulation mostly stems from the belief
                    that simulation of any kind can be generalized in a way to make it produce useful
                    information, whether it be for experimental or research purposes. This is
                    particularly true when elements may be abstracted away using gamification
                    as a vehicle to simplify complex problems into something that can be easily
                    simulated. I believe simulation is precisely the
                    methodology behind why evolutionary computing is fascinating,
                    and why it is responsible for a number of impressive and highly optimized
                    algorithms that don't require the computational complexity of a traditional
                    neural network or its training method.
